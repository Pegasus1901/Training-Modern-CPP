I want ot design an application to process10 recent transactions made by a user by fetching their details from data base

Operation:
Each transactions amount,time and reciept has to be printed to a log file

Note- 1 transaction has no relatiblity with others ie all transactions are mutually execlusive

every transaction has following state
    [transaction time|amount|source|destination]

// we use array here
//we need stack baased on array

Example 2

we design an appln where a new data value is recieved at a fixed interval and gets added at the back of the data values so far.
I want to process only the the oldest value from these value at a time and print the value on the console.

I am not allowed to modify and for as value gets processed, it needs to be removed from the transaction pending set.

//we use doubly linked list
//we need linked list based on a queue

Example 3
