IS A ,HAS A ....rule remember

1. Composition
2. Inheritance

try to avoid multiple inheritance

IS A -- relationship
//why inheritance??- 1. Generalization
                            Employee    BuisnessOwner   PrivateCompany
                            common- payTax(){diff. for all 3 classes}
                            to create a general class for different classes
                     2. Specialization(Card{Specialization of card class into types}-> debit,credit,visiting...etc)

to attach 5 types into one what to do
we need to use upcasting for Generalization type of problems

extend data types
OR combine classes to one

Extension- creating subclass,child,type,subtype.
Generalization- refering,Generalizing type ,creating base class


Association - two or more classes connected with each other without inheritance

    Basic Association(PERFORMS A....relationship)
        Bank Account        Bank Operation
        Bank b1             Operation obj
                Obj.widraw(Bank b);
    Composition
        HAS A relationship...
        the lifetime of composing obj is lifetime of composed obj
        A(Composed){Container}       b(Composing)
        --A container contains B
        --can be one to one OR one to many
        --outer obj will destroy inner obj when out of scope
    Aggrigation
        Car<-----wheels
        (1)         (4)
        --HAS A relationship
        --not mandatory if car obj is destroyed wheels also be destroyed
        --can be one to one OR one to many
        --Car cannot control lifetime of wheels/ deletion of obj but retaining subObj

**## UNIFORM INITLIZATION SYNTAX
        -----demo1.cpp-----
    Anything can be initlized using curly brckets

CONSTRUCTOR DELIGATION
one constructor A which takes 20 parameters and one B constructor takes 19 but 19 are same para.
we can call the B in A and initlize remaining in the scope of fn.

POLYMORPHISM
doing something in more than one way

ENCAPSULATION
hiding the internal representation of obj from outside world is encapsulation
